# Introduction to Web Development

Welcome to the exciting world of web development! This comprehensive guide will take you through the fundamentals of creating modern web applications.

## What is Web Development?

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves several key areas:

### Frontend Development
- **HTML**: The structure and content of web pages
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of web pages
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality and dynamic behavior

### Backend Development
- Server-side programming languages (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)
- Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- APIs and web services

### Full Stack Development
Combining both frontend and backend skills to create complete web applications.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Client-Server Architecture
- **Client**: The user's web browser
- **Server**: The computer that hosts the website
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: The protocol for communication

### 2. Responsive Design
Creating websites that work well on all devices:
- Desktop computers
- Tablets
- Mobile phones

### 3. Modern Development Tools
- Code editors (VS Code, Sublime Text)
- Version control (Git, GitHub)
- Package managers (npm, yarn)
- Build tools (Webpack, Vite)
